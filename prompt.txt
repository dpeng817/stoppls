We are in the root of an empty repository. This repository will be a python-based tool which runs as a background process on the user's mac to monitor incoming emails from a list of addresses, and uses AI to take automated actions on those emails. Here are some guidelines:
    we will use test driven development. we will _never_ move on from a task until all tests are passing.
    we will break up tasks to be as atomic as possible.
    we will use python as the primary language.
    unit tests will be written and run using pytest. to run python commands, create and use a uv virtualenv in the root of the directory.

Let's first come up with a plan of action for creating this tool. I want you to write out that plan as a simple text file, and then we'll edit that prompt until we agree on the plan.
