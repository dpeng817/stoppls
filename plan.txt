# Email Monitoring Tool - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A Python-based background process for Mac that monitors incoming emails from specified addresses and uses AI to take automated actions on those emails.

## Key Features
- Email monitoring (Gmail initially, extensible to other providers)
- AI-powered email analysis (Claude initially, extensible to other AI providers)
- Automated actions: replying, archiving, and filtering emails
- Natural language configuration interface (users describe rules in plaintext)
- YAML-based configuration storage

## Development Approach
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Write tests first, then implement functionality
- Atomic task breakdown: Complete one small feature at a time
- Python as primary language
- pytest for unit testing
- uv for virtual environment management

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure
1. Initialize project structure and virtual environment
   - Set up uv virtualenv
   - Create basic project structure
   - Set up pytest configuration
   - Create initial requirements.txt

2. Email monitoring core
   - Design email provider interface (starting with Gmail)
   - Implement Gmail API connection for reading emails
   - Create tests for email fetching functionality
   - Implement email fetching from specified addresses
   - Add secure credential management

3. Background process implementation
   - Design daemon/background process architecture
   - Create tests for background process functionality
   - Implement Mac-specific background process (launchd)
   - Add error handling and retry mechanisms

## Phase 2: Email Processing and AI Integration
1. Email parsing and data extraction
   - Design email parsing interface
   - Create tests for email content extraction
   - Implement email content extraction (text, attachments)

2. AI integration
   - Design AI service interface (starting with Claude)
   - Create tests for AI processing
   - Implement Claude API connection
   - Develop prompt engineering for email analysis
   - Create fallback mechanisms for API failures

3. Rule system
   - Design rule configuration schema
   - Create tests for rule parsing and matching
   - Implement rule engine
   - Develop natural language to rule conversion using AI

4. Action execution
   - Design action executor interface
   - Create tests for action types (reply, archive, filter)
   - Implement Gmail-specific action executors
   - Add error handling for failed actions

## Phase 3: Configuration and User Experience
1. Configuration management
   - Design YAML configuration interface
   - Create tests for configuration loading/saving
   - Implement configuration file handling
   - Add configuration validation

2. Natural language interface
   - Design interface for converting user instructions to rules
   - Create tests for NL processing
   - Implement AI-powered configuration generator

3. Logging and monitoring
   - Design logging interface
   - Create tests for logging functionality
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Add alerting for critical failures

4. User interface
   - Command-line interface for configuration
   - Status checking and manual triggers
   - Configuration validation and testing

## Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
1. Integration testing
   - End-to-end tests with mock email server
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing

2. Deployment
   - Create installation script
   - Document installation and configuration process
   - Create uninstallation process
   - Add update mechanism

## Initial Tasks Breakdown
1. Set up project structure and virtual environment
2. Create first test for Gmail API connection
3. Implement minimal Gmail connection functionality
4. Create test for email filtering by address
5. Implement email filtering functionality
6. Create test for secure credential storage
7. Implement credential management

Each task will follow the TDD cycle:
1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimal code to pass test
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing
4. Move to next task only when all tests pass
